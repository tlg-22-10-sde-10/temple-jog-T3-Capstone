## The Story

A temple in remote location, but it's actually an Alien ship. They’re trying to contact their home-world, so they can invade Earth. A Major Government power is looking to Nuke the whole area because **“It’s the only way to be sure”** they don’t contact their home-world. You are a part of a special ops team that has intel that states even if the site is nuked, the signal will still be sent. Your mission (and you already chose to accept it) is to infiltrate the temple and find a means to disable the communication device and get out before the nuke drops. You will be dropped to the south of the temple nearby. Your ex-filtration route will be back the way you came in. Ensure you get back to the pickup with enough time for us to pick you up. If you miss the window, we will not be able to safely extract you.

#### Game Flow

Navigate a maze, overcome obstacles, gather items and reach the aliens communications room under a maximum number of moves
